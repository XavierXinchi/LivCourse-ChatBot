In the first module, the large language model will combine the user's original question with the historical dialog to produce a processed question.

In the second module, the processed question will be sent to the Agent, which will generate a chain of thoughts to determine which category the question belongs to, and hand it over to the function of the corresponding category to generate the final answer.
