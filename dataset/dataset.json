It builds on the point-performance theory taught in year two, but whereas in the latter, point mass models suffice, it now becomes necessary formally to treat rigid-body motion in three dimensions; this is done by introducing angular momentum, rotating frames of reference, and the Newton-Euler equations. Notions of trim and of static and dynamic stability are introduced using various simplified reduced degree-of-freedom models, axis systems, and state and control variables. The standard six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) equations of motion of a rigid aeroplane are developed; it is shown how these can be solved numerically to enable accurate flight simulation, and how they can be linearized. The relationship between the linearizations and the aircraft’s natural modes is studied. Also introduced are a several important feedback control design methods, useful for modifying and improving aircraft stability and control characteristics. These include the Root Locus, Bode and Nyquist based design methods, and gain and phase margins as design goals. PID control and compensator design are also presented. Also discussed are linear state-space methods."

Second, we use Microsoft Excel to construct financial models of companies, models which can then be used for financial analysis and decision-making. Aspects of spreadsheet best practice, dealing with modelling complexity, and relevant Excel tips and shortcuts are covered. Successful students will possess an understanding of how to process all the typical transactions and adjustments of an SME using typical accounting software as well as a set of tools and techniques for modelling and forecasting the financials of a company. Such knowledge will reinforce their understanding of financial accounting, as well as constituting invaluable practical skills that could be applied in future part-time, placement or graduate employment. The module is delivered by means of an initial lecture, practical workshops in computer labs, as well as videos and webinars of relevant examples and material. Assessment is via two assignments: one using Sage and the other using Excel to construct a financial model."

A range of decision-making techniques are covered (such as pricing decisions, making best use of scarce resources, and dealing with risk and uncertainty). Further uses of standard costing and variance analysis for controlling business performance are examined. Measuring divisional performance and the setting of transfer prices in divisionalised businesses are discussed, as well as performance analysis in the public and private sectors. Many of these themes will be further built upon in the final year in looking at performance management systems, measurement and control. Successful students will therefore possess a thorough grounding in the methods used by management accountants, and will be well-prepared for final-year study in the subject (ACFI303 Advanced Management Accounting).

Since the 1970s, it has been widely recognised that entrepreneurship contributes to economic growth and that the majority of new jobs are generated by small firms. Moreover, for some years now, there has been a wide range of publicly funded business support initiatives aimed at enhancing entrepreneurship and enterprise creation. Since the onset of the recession in 2008, the challenge is to create new business opportunities, in the UK, Europe, and beyond which are able to survive and thrive in the emerging business ecosystem. In this context, the role of education, especially in universities, in ‘nurturing’ entrepreneurs through providing the necessary skills and training for students, is increasingly viewed as an important element in the development of new graduate start-ups that have the potential to become high-growth firms. In this module, building upon material studied earlier in the programme, focus will be directed towards questions such as how and why ‘entrepreneurship and enterprise’ have become such a popular phrase for individuals, organisations, communities and governments alike. The module will seek to explore this by examining the various historical, economic, political and social assumptions that surround the nature of entrepreneurship and enterprise, drawing focus towards advancing our understanding and appreciation of the human story behind entrepreneurial and enterprising activity. and It will also seek to advance students’ awareness of entrepreneurial practice by considering in greater detail the many individual stories (from emerging, growing and mature business start-ups) in order to appreciate the factors and challenges involved in “the practice of being entrepreneurial / entrepreneur”. In the module students will also have the opportunity to evaluate their personal orientations to entrepreneurship, building upon material studied earlier in the programme, by reflexively shaping their appreciation of what it is like being self-employed, working in the family business, being an owner-manager, being an entrepreneur/intrapreneur."

A range of decision-making techniques are covered (such as pricing decisions, making best use of scarce resources, and dealing with risk and uncertainty). Further uses of standard costing and variance analysis for controlling business performance are examined. Measuring divisional performance and the setting of transfer prices in divisionalised businesses are discussed, as well as performance analysis in the public and private sectors.

The module is taught by lecture (2 x 1 hour lectures per week) and workshops (2 during the semester, 2 hours each). Assessment is via case study analysis (40%) and an open book examination (60%). There will also be formative tests during the term. This module is identical to PHIL272, except that it runs in Semester 1."

Since the 1970s, it has been widely recognised that entrepreneurship contributes to economic growth and that the majority of new jobs are generated by small firms. Moreover, for some years now, there has been a wide range of publicly funded business support initiatives aimed at enhancing entrepreneurship and enterprise creation. Since the onset of the recession in 2008, the challenge is to create new business opportunities, in the UK, Europe, and beyond which are able to survive and thrive in the emerging business ecosystem. In this context, the role of education, especially in universities, in ‘nurturing’ entrepreneurs through providing the necessary skills and training for students, is increasingly viewed as an important element in the development of new graduate start-ups that have the potential to become high-growth firms. In this module, building upon material studied earlier in the programme, focus will be directed towards questions such as how and why ‘entrepreneurship and enterprise’ have become such a popular phrase for individuals, organisations, communities and governments alike. The module will seek to explore this by examining the various historical, economic, political and social assumptions that surround the nature of entrepreneurship and enterprise, drawing focus towards advancing our understanding and appreciation of the human story behind entrepreneurial and enterprising activity. and It will also seek to advance students’ awareness of entrepreneurial practice by considering in greater detail the many individual stories (from emerging, growing and mature business start-ups) in order to appreciate the factors and challenges involved in “the practice of being entrepreneurial / entrepreneur”. In the module students will also have the opportunity to evaluate their personal orientations to entrepreneurship, building upon material studied earlier in the programme, by reflexively shaping their appreciation of what it is like being self-employed, working in the family business, being an owner-manager, being an entrepreneur/intrapreneur."

Many quantities can be expressed as the limiting value of a sequence of approximations, for example the slope of a tangent to a curve, the rate of change of a function, the area under a curve, and so on. Calculus provides us with tools for studying all of these, and more. Many of the ideas can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, but calculus as we now understand it was first developed in the 17th Century, independently by Newton and Leibniz. The modern form presented in this module was fully worked out in the late 19th Century. MATH101 lays the foundation for the use of calculus in more advanced modules on differential equations, differential geometry, theoretical physics, stochastic analysis, and many other topics. It begins from the very basics – the notions of real number, sequence, limit, real function, and continuity – and uses these to give a rigorous treatment of derivatives and integrals for real functions of one real variable."

It is the study of lines, planes, and subspaces and their intersections using algebra. Linear algebra first emerged from the study of determinants, which were used to solve systems of linear equations. Determinants were used by Leibniz in 1693, and subsequently, Cramer’s Rule for solving linear systems was devised in 1750. Later, Gauss further developed the theory of solving linear systems by using Gaussian elimination. All these classical themes, in their modern interpretation, are included in the module, which culminates in a detailed study of eigenproblems. A part of the module is devoted to complex numbers which are basically just planar vectors. Linear algebra is central to both pure and applied mathematics. This module is an essential pre-requisite for nearly all modules taught in the Department of Mathematical Sciences."

These usually require lengthy iterative processes that are tedious and error prone for humans (even with a calculator), but ideally suited to computers. The first few lectures of this module demonstrate how computer programs can be written to handle calculations of this type automatically. These ideas will be used throughout the module.

We then generalize basic calculus by considering the optimization of functionals, e.g., integrals involving an unknown function and its derivatives, which leads to a wide variety of ODEs and PDEs. After those systems of two linear first-order PDEs and second-order PDES are classified and reduced to ODEs where possible. In certain cases, e.g., `elliptic’ PDEs like the Laplace equation, such a reduction is impossible.

Calculus provides us with tools for studying all of these, and more. Many of the ideas can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, but calculus as we now understand it was first developed in the 17th Century, independently by Newton and Leibniz. The modern form presented in this module was fully worked out in the late 19th Century. MATH101 lays the foundation for the use of calculus in more advanced modules on differential equations, differential geometry, theoretical physics, stochastic analysis, and many other topics. It begins from the very basics – the notions of real number, sequence, limit, real function, and continuity – and uses these to give a rigorous treatment of derivatives and integrals for real functions of one real variable."

It is the study of lines, planes, and subspaces and their intersections using algebra. Linear algebra first emerged from the study of determinants, which were used to solve systems of linear equations. Determinants were used by Leibniz in 1693, and subsequently, Cramer’s Rule for solving linear systems was devised in 1750. Later, Gauss further developed the theory of solving linear systems by using Gaussian elimination. All these classical themes, in their modern interpretation, are included in the module, which culminates in a detailed study of eigenproblems. A part of the module is devoted to complex numbers which are basically just planar vectors. Linear algebra is central to both pure and applied mathematics. This module is an essential pre-requisite for nearly all modules taught in the Department of Mathematical Sciences."

It has broadly 5 parts and each part contains two types of equations: those that can be solved by specific methods and others that cannot be solved but can only be studied to understand some properties of the underlying equations and their solutions. The main topics are first order ODEs, second order ODEs, systems of ODEs, first-order PDEs and some of the most well-known second-order PDEs, namely the wave, heat and Laplace equations."

The guiding idea will be to start using the powerful tools of analysis, familiar to the students from the first year module MATH101 (Calculus I) in the context of the real numbers, to vectors (multivariable analysis) and to functions (functional analysis). The notions of convergence and continuity will be reinterpreted in the more general setting of metric spaces. This will provide the language to prove several fundamental results that are in the basic toolkit of a mathematician, like the Picard Theorem on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to first order differential equations with an initial datum, and the implicit function theorem. The module is central for a curriculum in pure and applied mathematics, as familiarity with these notions will help students who want to take several other subsequent modules as well as many projects. This module is also a useful preparation (although not a formal prerequisite) for MATH365 Measure theory and probability, a very useful module for a deep understanding of financial mathematics."

Other problems involve the use of ‘real world’ data, which don’t fit neatly into simple mathematical models. In both cases, we can make further progress using approximate methods. These usually require lengthy iterative processes that are tedious and error prone for humans (even with a calculator), but ideally suited to computers. The first few lectures of this module demonstrate how computer programs can be written to handle calculations of this type automatically. These ideas will be used throughout the module. We then investigate how errors propagate through numerical computations. The focus then shifts to numerical methods for finding roots, approximating integrals and interpolating data. In each case, we will examine the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, in terms of accuracy and efficiency."

We then generalize basic calculus by considering the optimization of functionals, e.g., integrals involving an unknown function and its derivatives, which leads to a wide variety of ODEs and PDEs. After those systems of two linear first-order PDEs and second-order PDES are classified and reduced to ODEs where possible. In certain cases, e.g., `elliptic’ PDEs like the Laplace equation, such a reduction is impossible.

It builds on the point-performance theory taught in year two, but whereas in the latter, point mass models suffice, it now becomes necessary formally to treat rigid-body motion in three dimensions; this is done by introducing angular momentum, rotating frames of reference, and the Newton-Euler equations. Notions of trim and of static and dynamic stability are introduced using various simplified reduced degree-of-freedom models, axis systems, and state and control variables. The standard six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) equations of motion of a rigid aeroplane are developed; it is shown how these can be solved numerically to enable accurate flight simulation, and how they can be linearized. The relationship between the linearizations and the aircraft’s natural modes is studied. Also introduced are a several important feedback control design methods, useful for modifying and improving aircraft stability and control characteristics. These include the Root Locus, Bode and Nyquist based design methods, and gain and phase margins as design goals. PID control and compensator design are also presented. Also discussed are linear state-space methods."

Such specifications are used to give a precise and unambiguous description of the required system. In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

The course will introduce issues from a problem (user-driven) perspective and a technology-driven perspective where users have new categories of software problems that they need to be solved, and where technology producers create technologies that present new opportunities for software products. It will be expected that students will read articles in the software engineering research literature, and will discuss these articles in a seminar-style forum."

The latest increase in computer power ensured broad use of the algorithms to solve problems in science and engineering previously considered impossible to tackle. ANNs are now broadly used in pattern recognition, including speech recognition and classification problems, statistics, functional analysis, modelling financial series with considerable stochasticity, etc. GAs are search procedures based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. They provide effective solutions to a variety of optimisation problems in economics, linguistics, engineering, and computer science. Both ANNs and GAs can exploit massively parallel architectures to speed up problem solving and provide further understanding of intelligence and adaptation.The main goals of the module are to introduce students to some of the established work in the field of Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms and their applications, particularly in relation to multidisciplinary research. To equip students with a broad overview of the field, placing it in a historical and scientific context.

Such specifications are used to give a precise and unambiguous description of the required system. In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

Multi-agent systems are important primarily because they have been found to have very wide applicability, in areas as diverse as industrial process control and electronic commerce. This module will begin by introducing the student to the notion of an agent, and will lead them to an understanding of what an agent is, how they can be constructed, and how agents can be made to co-operate effectively with one another to solve problems."

ANNs are now broadly used in pattern recognition, including speech recognition and classification problems, statistics, functional analysis, modelling financial series with considerable stochasticity, etc. GAs are search procedures based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. They provide effective solutions to a variety of optimisation problems in economics, linguistics, engineering, and computer science. Both ANNs and GAs can exploit massively parallel architectures to speed up problem solving and provide further understanding of intelligence and adaptation.The main goals of the module are to introduce students to some of the established work in the field of Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms and their applications, particularly in relation to multidisciplinary research.

The module is taught by a mixture of power points notes and chalk and talk. There are a number of question sheets given out to help the students understand the basis plasma-material processes.

Such specifications are used to give a precise and unambiguous description of the required system. In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

ANNs are now broadly used in pattern recognition, including speech recognition and classification problems, statistics, functional analysis, modelling financial series with considerable stochasticity, etc. GAs are search procedures based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. They provide effective solutions to a variety of optimisation problems in economics, linguistics, engineering, and computer science. Both ANNs and GAs can exploit massively parallel architectures to speed up problem solving and provide further understanding of intelligence and adaptation.The main goals of the module are to introduce students to some of the established work in the field of Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms and their applications, particularly in relation to multidisciplinary research. To equip students with a broad overview of the field, placing it in a historical and scientific context.

In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

In addition, as computational systems become more complex in general, formal specification can allow us to define the key characteristics of systems in a clear way and so help the development process. Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

A multi-agent system is one composed of multiple interacting software components known as agents, which are typically capable of co-operating to solve problems that are beyond the abilities of any individual member. Multi-agent systems are important primarily because they have been found to have very wide applicability, in areas as diverse as industrial process control and electronic commerce. This module will begin by introducing the student to the notion of an agent, and will lead them to an understanding of what an agent is, how they can be constructed, and how agents can be made to co-operate effectively with one another to solve problems."

Formal specifications provide the basis for verification of properties of systems. While there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, the model-checking approach is a practical and popular way to verify the temporal properties of finite-state systems. Indeed, such temporal verification is widely used within the design of critical parts of integrated circuits, has recently been used to verify parts of the control mechanism for one of NASA’s space probes, and is now beginning to be used to verify general Java programs. This module will introduce: the principles of standard formal methods, such as Z; the basic notions of temporal logic and its use in relation to reactive systems; the use of model checking techniques in the verification of reactive systems."

Multi-agent systems are important primarily because they have been found to have very wide applicability, in areas as diverse as industrial process control and electronic commerce. This module will begin by introducing the student to the notion of an agent, and will lead them to an understanding of what an agent is, how they can be constructed, and how agents can be made to co-operate effectively with one another to solve problems."

The module explains how a gas can turn into a plasma and how high energy ions in the plasma can be generated to process a substrate, such as silicon wafer in micro-electronics fabrication. The module is taught by a mixture of power points notes and chalk and talk. There are a number of question sheets given out to help the students understand the basis plasma-material processes. On completion, students will understand how plasmas are used in industry, they will have an appreciation of some aspects of simple design and how plasmas can be configured for the next generation of fusion power stations."

It aims to provide the background for later modules, relevant final year projects, but particularly for employment in those industries that are firmly based in microelectronics technology. It develops the concept of design as being more than simple problem solving, but something demanding high levels of innovation still based on sound physical principles. In this respect it builds on earlier work in Engineering Electromagnetism and Integrated Electronics and Design. They are not, however, essential for students to undertake this module.

It concentrates on the engineering principles behind plasma technology rather than the physics of the discharge, however some mathematical approaches are explored so that quantification of the action of plasmas upon material surfaces can be made. The module explains how a gas can turn into a plasma and how high energy ions in the plasma can be generated to process a substrate, such as silicon wafer in micro-electronics fabrication. The module is taught by a mixture of power points notes and chalk and talk. There are a number of question sheets given out to help the students understand the basis plasma-material processes. On completion, students will understand how plasmas are used in industry, they will have an appreciation of some aspects of simple design and how plasmas can be configured for the next generation of fusion power stations."
